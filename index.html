                    Indian-origin religions Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism,
                    are all based on the concepts of dharma and karma. Ahimsa,
                    philosophy of nonviolence, is an important aspect of native Indian
                    faiths.

                <p>
                    For generations, India has a prevailing tradition of the joint
                    family system. It is when extended members of a family - parents,
                    children, the children's spouses and their offspring, etc. - live
                    together. Usually, the oldest male member is the head of the joint
                    Indian family system. He mostly makes all important decisions and
                    rules, and other family members are likely to abide by them.
